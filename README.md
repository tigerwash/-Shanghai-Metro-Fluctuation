This project visualizes the passenger flow fluctuation of the Shanghai subway system in 2016 by Processing (Java-based). This app provides multiple ways of functional interaction with "select", "start", "pause".etc. The thickness of each line represents the passenger flow of that day. The analysis of space-time variation reveals evidence-based solutions for urban congestion and regional disparities.
